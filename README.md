# GGD-grapics-engine
An incredibly simple graphics engine with very basic functionality. I plan on adding more functions and using it as a fun way of making myself learn CG. In pracice you will notice it is just my personal revamp of the old way of drawing graphics where you would directly write to a memory buffer, only here instead of writing raw RGB, you use a Pixel struct and instead of being software rendered, GGD uses OpenGL. WARNING: LEGACY OPENGL IS AT USE (i couldnt be bothered tbh, I just need a simple graphics library for myself). There is a small demo which is compiled when you use the Makefile.
