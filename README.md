# Unspritable
Unspritable is an incredibly simple graphics framwork with very basic functionality. I plan on adding more functions as I am using it as a fun way of making myself learn computer graphics. Unspritable invites programers to use as fiew assets as possible, instead using code to fill up the screen, it is for this reason that I am working on adding easy shader compatibility in order to allow for more ways of drawing. The OpenGL code will be removed soon. WARNING: LEGACY OPENGL IS AT USE (i couldnt be bothered tbh, I just need a simple graphics library for myself). There is a small demo which is compiled when you use the Makefile.
